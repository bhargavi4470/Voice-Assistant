## Voice Assistant

This project is an intelligent, open-source voice assistant designed to enhance productivity and simplify daily tasks through natural language interaction. It utilizes advanced speech recognition and synthesis technologies to enable seamless voice command processing, making it suitable for a variety of applications ranging from personal use to smart home integration.

### Features
- **Voice Command Recognition:** Effectively understands user spoken commands with high accuracy.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Interprets and responds to natural language queries and commands.
- **Task Automation:** Supports executing tasks such as setting reminders, alarms, weather forecasts, and more.
- **Information Retrieval:** Fetches data from web sources, APIs, or local databases.
- **Smart Device Control:** Integrates with IoT devices and smart home components for voice-controlled automation.
- **Multilingual Support:** Capable of understanding and responding in multiple languages.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Modular design allows easy addition of new features, plugins, or integrations.

### Technologies Used
- Speech Recognition (e.g., Google Speech API, offline models)
- Text-to-Speech Conversion (e.g., pyttsx3, gTTS)
- Python for core logic
- APIs for integrations (e.g., weather, news, calendar)
- Machine Learning models for improved understanding and contextual responses
